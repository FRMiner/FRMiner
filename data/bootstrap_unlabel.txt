I wonder why something basic like hiding a tab is not shown in the docs :(. diverdude: it's not in the docs for 3 reasons: 1) neither you, nor anybody else made some free time to write such an example for the docs. Remember that bootstrap is an open source project, driven by enthusiasts like you, who contribute in their spare time.. 2) the scope of bootstrap is to provide a bare-bones scaffolding framework for common use cases. hiding a tab is not a common use case.. 3) the reason it's not a common use case is that it would break UX: tabbed views are supposed to show what else is there, not randomly change tab layouts. maybe you don't want to show a tab just for one group of users?

The centered 1280p layout is just a matter of having everything in a div with a `.container` class. Ill take another look. I had issued when putting a 1280 div around it that the sidebar would be fixed to the left side of the screen instead of left within the div. I am probably just too tired now lol. THe sidebar isn't something bootstrap provides, but you can easily copy & modify classes to faciliate a fixed sidebar, just like the fixed navbar. Bent0: wait your sidebar is supposed to be fixed into the container?. Bent0: then it's a simple grid column, no?. Yeah so boxed layout: 1280px container, in that a fixed topnav and sidebar. So when you scroll it only scrolls the content portion and everything else stays boxed and fixed in place.

Aha that's what I've done, I also tried it with cards and col-* for seeing how will it behave/look like.

So I just add the class to the row div no need to wrap it in another div. here's how to do that:. From what I've seen in other templates people usually create custom classes and wrap bootstrap elements in divs with custom classes, i'm not sure if they use a program to generate those templates or it's the correct way to do it. Nightelf_: yes, generally, a class should be applied to the element it's doing changes to. no need to create a bunch of divs.. Nightelf_: a lot of people don't really grasp the idea of how CSS works, or how to design maintainable, reusable components :).

Simply overwrite any CSS rules in your own CSS.. ok so do i need to use important tags ?. dashboard background can change , and it's an inline style , i can't override it with css rules ,. marot: hm i see, the print.less file disables the background with an `!important`.. normally you should not use !important in your code, but in this case i think you have no choice. Thinking about it, you might have an easier time removing the print.less from the includes like I described above, otherwise you run into an endless war of `!important` statements. yes i think it's the best way , but if i use the print.less file users who install dependencies with npm will get the original bootstrap no ?. and i can't ask to all users to do a manual install for it. marot: the files that get installed through npm are simply lying around in `node_modules`, your app doesn't know anything about them. Only when gulp parses the gulpfile, the files in node_modules are read and compiled (or whatever the gulpfile tells gulp to do).. The trick is to go into your gulpfile, and find the line that includes the official bootstrap. And change the line to instead include your modified version of the bootstrap.less (the entry point) which doesn't include the print line. ok i'll try this thank you. the bootstrap.less looks like this:. it's the entry point that includes all bootstrap modules. find that in your node_modeules, copy it into your local source folder (but only that one file, not the entire bootstrap directory) and remove the print line.. you might have to change the file paths because bootstrap's less files wil be in the node_modules directory, but that file isn't.. then change the gulpfile <unconvertable>. thx a lot i finally did it. ;)", "comments": [], "label": []}

Es0teric: you mean a navbar, right? here are some examples to get it right:. Keep in mind bootstrap is a mobile-first framework, so mobile works by default, and then to make desktop work you usually need to put some work in.. hoek it does not work by default for some reason. mobile nav menu is not working by default. Es0teric: can you upload an example to Codepen?. hoek. Es0teric: here's a preview with the coments removed and text links instead of images:. for me the menu is responsive when resizing to mobile size. is that what you expect?. yeah. give me a sec to check it. hoek i dont understand what you did different. Es0teric: check if you actually pull in bootstrap 4.1.x in your theme. also check if some other plugin is pulling in wordpress 3.x as well. there might be a conflict arising due to that. you're creating a wordpress theme i assume. i pull in 4.0.x. not 4.1. i am pulling in WP 5.x definitely. ok any reason whny not 4.1? but again, problem might be that someone else's plugin is pulling in bootstrap 3.x as well, so you might have conflicts there. there is no plugin that is pulling in bootstrap 3.x. this is literally from scratch. hoek. yes, so I'm afraid you'll have to debug further what the issue might be: basically bootstrap works, but as soon as being put in your dev env it stops. that's normally a sure indicator of some css mixup. also just to be sure, try pulling in the newest bs version 4.1.x. hmmm", "comments": [], "label": []}

It's not supported anymore, and getting new browsers supported is not a small task. Do you absolutely have to support IE11 for a client/work?. unfortunately yes, they have chosen a framework that has been reliant on BS3, and IE 11 used by the majority of users ...trust me, if i was able to place a big fat width 100% sticker on the website telling them to use chrome/firefox i would. I see, but this is a client expectation management problem. A client who introduces IE11 and BS3 as constraints will have to get an invoice of 2-3x what you would normally charge.. If you communicate that and they say \"sure, let's do it, it's important' then you start.. dw that all been negotiated ;) i try avoid IE like the plague, but unfortunately this clients clients...are of the...older variety, so i have no choice. and they have already purchased a prebuilt theme. just a big facepalm tbh. Sure, i just mention that because too many consultants, when starting out, panic when the client says 'ah, by the way, this site also has to work with IE9, shouldnt be a problem, righty?'. the prebuilt theme cost them 50$ on themeforest. ask them if they really are ready to pay $5000+ for your and your bosses work up-front (implementation) and then $500 monthly (maintenance, bug fixing) just to save another 49$ on themeforest.. just another big headache for this mix..... its based on the Magento framework....so any theme changes = downtime - is why i was originally going to patch it. Tell them this calculation, it's expected from you to be warned about this. You're being hired as the professional, what would they know?. tbf just want this job out the way :P bad but quick and dirty >.>. so what would be my choice putting into perspective that a theme change is not poss. Well the problem with these kind of things is that they are energy holes. Microsoft will be pushing breaking updates to IE11, and they'll want to constantly add more features to their site. They have to understand that by choosing BS3, they're making you do pioneer work every time by finding out how to make things work. hirsty: a theme change is perfectly possible, but you have to make sure they never again do a technical decision (buying a theme) without professional consultation (talk to you). hirsty: present them a few options: a) do all the compatibility work (very expensive long-term) b) buy another theme based on bs4 (49-490$) or c) if they like their already purchased theme so much, make you refactor that exact theme into bs4. (have a non-exclusivity contract so you can resell that theme even if you want). @hook already have the agreement with them on a patch by patch basis ;). just this one was a bit of a head scratcher. ok, then back to the original question, the JS event shown.bs.tab (i didn't realize it's not a domain name and clicked on it -.-) doesn't work in IE11? Do you have an idea why? It's jQuery after all, so... any errors in the console?. do you have `<meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\">` in your header?. No errors, i think its just not adding the event listener...currently as a improv ive added the click event listener in there which really isnt a solution.... but it gets to the code in my function. @hook any idea. haha... hirsty: hm no idea, does jquery work in general on that site?. hirsty: do you have `<meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\">` in your header?. hirsty: seems to be a common problem with jquery and ie11:. yes i do. even tried adding chrome=1 to it", "comments": [], "label": []}

Any clues as to why?. wellick: your icon is a inline svg. the class change is then applied to the element that is an inline svg of a play button.. wellick: depending on how you want to use fontawesome, either change the entire icon to become a pause icon (not just the svg's class since that doesn't cause the desired effect) or use web-font/css icons (<span> elements with classes). hoek, ah! that's interesting. I hadn't noticed the i class remained the same.. now the challenge is how to change it. this is weird.. wellick: `For this case you may still want the <i> tags to be replaced with <svg> tags. This is the default behavior when using the CDN or fontawesome-free and fontawesome-pro packages. This does not happen automatically when using the core package.`. wellick: from. you're using fontawesome 5.x free, right?. wellick: if you're used to the old fontawesome, it's a bit confusing since the 5.x version introduced svg rendering by default. you can switch back to webfont/css rendering. which would make your code work. or go in the svg direction and use the JS api of fontawesome. by switch back to webfont/cs rendering you mean using the core package?. yes I'm using 5.x. I'm not used to the old font awesome since it's the first time i'm doing anything web dev ;). ah ok in that case i think this will be the way you want to change the icons:. wellick: also make sure you update the included fontawesome :). i'm not using jQuery on this project!. let me dive into the docs and see if i can make this.. thanks for the help!. np, good luck!. although i'm stuck right at the beggining lol. i don't get the node example. does that mean we are importing the font awesome library to our back end?. could be done, but not necessarily. hoek: around?. ilbelkyr: yes, hey. alright :). I assume you're still interested in being the new channel founder?. ilbelkyr: yes, unless someone objects to that :). doesn't look like there's much of a community to object to anything. hoek: /msg ChanServ register ##bootstrap. you won't be opped by default when joining the channel, but can op up as needed using \"/msg ChanServ op ##bootstrap\". If you want to add more ops, take a look at /msg ChanServ help flags, I recommend +Aeiortv as a decent flagset for ops you trust. and of course, while opped, you can adjust the topic. For example to update the version in there :). as always, feel free to ask staff (in #freenode or /msg) if there's anything else you need help with. ilbelkyr: thank you so much! i'll make sure to update everything and do a bit of housekeeping and brush up my irc skills in the following days :). you're welcome, happy to help :). aaaah finally. hoek: Why is it working for the button though? Changes from green to orange and vice versa, using the same method. It's the same principle.. if you can still remember the page that is :D. wellick: the thing is that you're creating an <i> element, but fontawesome's javascript changes that into an inline-svg element. if it were still an <i> element while you change the class, everything would work.. ah yes, nevermind. i forgot the button was bootstrap not font awesome!. wellick: have a look at the play icon in yor browser's devtools, and see how it changes when you press it. wellick: yes :). well, to be honest the fa core package is proving to be a bit advanced for my skillset atm. I did made it work though, I think.

It creates the relevant col classes etc.. hm hard to see what's going on, i see no reason why it should not work.. :/. Ah my bad.. It's because of breakpoint-max(). But this is annoying.

I guess.. exactly. only that today, there's no dropping things in folders anymore, but you use package managers that take care about versioning and dependency management. hoxolotl: so you say \"yarn install bootstrap\" instead of downloading a zip.. npm install jquery ( for my local build/test) was enough :). yes, or npm. i'd suggest getting bootstrap 4 through npm as well though. but yes, it's a sane suggestion. php+django is fine, as any other backend language (symfony, java, ...). erm python+django.

I guess it's not helping that i'm very frustrated at this point. so, I'm gonna start again. from scratch. xrandr: hm, you can compare two directories' contents (`diff` under Linux, or some other visual diff tool) so you see what the eclipse plugin does. xrandr: or you check the changes into git (1x with vim and 1x with eclipse) and compare the two commits and see what's going on. that's an idea.

Example: class=\"col-12 col-md-6\". What does that mean? It could mean two things:. a) make everything col-12, but starting from the \"md\" screen size, make everything be 6 columns wide.. b) make everything col-12, but up until the \"md\" screen size, make everything 6 columns wide.. Bootstrap resolves this ambivalence by defining: The mobile version (up until the md screen size) gets the default size of the 12 columns width in this example. It's basically saying \"If you don't say anything, I understand that it applies to the mobile version until overruled otherwise.\". Happy easter btw. ok, so in example A - xs and sm get 12 columns, and from md and up get 6 columns. right?. Happy easter to you too!. exactly.. actually, example A and B are the same, just different semantical wording. actually no. i re-read that. in example b, xs, sm, and md would be 6 columns, and everything else 12 columns. let me rephrase:. 1) class=\"col-12 col-md-6\". 2) class=\"col-md-6 col-12\". both are being understood as example a). example b) will never happen.. example b) will be created by one of the following:. 3) class=\"col-6 col-lg-12\". 4) class=\"col-lg-12 col-6\".

I'm loosing my mind here. (this is a simplified exemple of something I'm trying to achieve). vicovico_: can you reupload to. vicovico_: also just in case it's not a typo: it's `m-auto` :). ah you want it left aligned, i see. no I want it right align. My tutorial says \"ml-auto\", is this wrong ?. s/left/right. here you are :. hoek : see it is crazy, with either mr-auto or ml-auto it doesn't want to align right.. tried mx-auto as well to center it, it doesn't want to. and the badges are not displayed as they should as well. somehow the framework does'nt respond correctly. vicovico_: ok so first off, always use the official docs. it's written in a much easier, understandable way than any tutorial, and it's always up to date, whereas any tutorial will be outdated the moment they publish it. for the badges, try `badge-primary` instead of `badge-default`:. for the layout, try the flexbox utilities:. the problem is that you're creating a list, and the badges are <span> elements which are inline elements by default (= they don't expand to the full width), so there's no margin on the left by default.. I figured doing the tutorial with the same bootstrap version as them would work (it's an Angular video formation where they use bootstrap, and they are doing it right in front of my eyes with bootstrap 4.0.0 and it is working!!). But you are right, much better to use the official documentation. heard about flex, I'm going to check it out. so there is an explanation, that's a start ^^, thank you hoek. have a cup of tea and skim that example list on the flex docs, it's giving you all kind of possible layout combinations..", "comments": [], "label": []}
